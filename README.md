<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A project made to learn and implement the Huffman Algorithm and lossless compression.

Allowed for greater understanding of binary trees and their traversal via recursion.

### Skills Developed

- Understanding of binary tree traversals
  - Post-Order
  - Pre-Order
- Usage of the huffman algorithm
- Compression and decompression of bits through lossless compression

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/karanvirheer/File-Compressor.git
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

To compress your files up to 53% of their original size. Allows for files to be decompressed back to original size.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
